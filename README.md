# IoT Cold Chain monitoring

## Project overview

The Cold Chain Monitoring is a software platform that collects conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) data from physical devices (IoT sensors) to monitor sensetive products as they move through the supply chain.

## Posible use cases for the solution

- *Pharmaceutical*: Ensure the safety and efficacy of vaccines and medications during storage and transportation.
- *Food*: Prevent spoilage and maintain freshness of perishable food products, such as meat, fish, and dairy.
- *Biotech*: Ensure accuracy and prevent degradation of biological samples, such as DNA and RNA.
- *Chemical*: Prevent contamination and ensure stability of sensitive chemicals during storage and transportation.
- *Electronic*: Prevent damage and ensure proper functioning of sensitive electronics during storage and transportation.
